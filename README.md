1. 	**Page** - Contains classes with variable and method descriptions for specific screens.
2.	**Tests** - Contains classes with ui-tests.
3.	**Extensions** - Contains extensions for XCUIElement to eliminate code duplication in methods from the Page folder. It also includes an extension for specific tests to handle system alerts.

A total of 15 tests have been written to verify the main scenarios identified during exploratory testing of the application.
